# Titanic-Survival-Prediction-using-python
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a classic beginner-level machine learning task that demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied to real-world datasets. Using passenger information such as age, gender, ticket class, number of siblings or spouses aboard, and embarkation port, the goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster. The dataset, which is publicly available on Kaggle, is widely used in data science competitions and learning exercises because it contains a mix of numerical and categorical features, as well as missing values that require careful preprocessing.

In this project, the data is first explored and cleaned to handle missing values and remove irrelevant features such as passenger names, ticket numbers, and cabin identifiers. Categorical variables like gender and embarkation port are converted into numerical form using one-hot encoding, while missing ages are replaced with the median age to maintain data consistency. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets to build and evaluate the predictive model.

For modeling, a Logistic Regression classifier is used since the target variable (survived or not) is binary. The model is trained on the training dataset and then tested to measure its accuracy and overall performance. Evaluation is carried out using metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report, which provide deeper insights into how well the model predicts survival for different passenger categories. On average, the model achieves an accuracy of around 75â€“80%, making it a strong baseline approach for this dataset.

Additionally, the project includes an example of predicting survival for a sample passenger profile to demonstrate real-world usage of the trained model. While Logistic Regression is a simple and interpretable algorithm, this project can be extended further by experimenting with more advanced models such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to improve performance. Overall, the Titanic Survival Prediction project serves as an excellent introduction to data preprocessing, feature engineering, and supervised learning using Python, and it lays the foundation for more complex machine learning applications.
